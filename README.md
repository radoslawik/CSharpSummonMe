## WPF application with MVVM pattern to retrieve League of Legends summoner information

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 with C# .NET tools
- Newtonsoft JSON package
- Riot Games Developer API key

### Installation Tips
- To install [Newtonsoft](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) you can use NuGet Package Manager. You can find the tutorial [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio).
- To get your developer key you have to visit [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/) website.
**Warning:** To get your key you may be asked to download the game, to play the tutorial and to confirm your email address.
- To be able to use the application you have to manually create file `API/YourDeveloperKey.txt` and paste your developer key. Make sure that file you have created is copied into output directory.
**Tip:** Key is formatted in this way `RGAPI-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`


### Examples of valid summoner
You can search for any player, but if you do not know single summoner name you can try one of these:

Summoner  | Region
------------- | -------------
 Mitr0vav0  | EUN1
IchMagToastbrot  | EUN1
HomeWorkGuy | EUW1

**Tip:** Go to Leaderboard tab within the application to get more summoner names
